# E-Commerce App created to learn the specific knowhow and adapt some libraries

## @chec/commerce.js
<p> Great library to manage products and logistics. There is a need to create an account that will provide the needed APIs that will populate our webapp.</p>

<p> It also has a functionality for adding products to cart. I need to find out if there is a possibility of customers adding their own products</p>

<p> With <italic> total_items </italic> we can modify the navbar cart to show the total number of items by sharing it as a parameter. We can then render the cart for it to show all our checkout items.</p>
